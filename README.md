Abandoned, simple notepad app by BanderLabs forked from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/banderlabs/wiki/Notepad).

I have no association with BanderLabs. I have been using this app on my Android phone for a few years. I wanted to preserve the source and apk because it was announced that Google code will be going away, and also because this application is no longer available in the Play Store.

Based on Google's tutorial [NotePad] (https://code.google.com/p/banderlabs/wiki/Notepad) app.
